# GMT Surface — Spline Surface Modelling of the Kuril-Kamchatka and Mariana Trenches

GMT (Generic Mapping Tools) shell scripts interpolating scattered XYZ point data into continuous gridded surfaces and mapping the results. Raw ASCII point data (topography and gravity) are block-averaged and gridded with GMT's surface adjustable-tension continuous-curvature spline algorithm, then illuminated and rendered as shaded-relief maps. The examples cover the Kuril-Kamchatka and Mariana Trenches and support figures in the author's marine-geophysical and cartographic publications.

## What the scripts do

- inspect the XYZ data range (gmtinfo)
- block-mean average the raw ASCII XYZ table to the grid resolution (blockmean)
- interpolate to a continuous grid with adjustable tension (surface -T)
- compute gradient / illumination (grdgradient)
- generate a colour palette (makecpt) and render the shaded surface (grdimage)
- add colour scale bar (psscale), grid, scale bar, rose (psbasemap), annotations (pstext) and the GMT logo (logo)
- export to raster (psconvert) at high resolution

Typical workflow: 1-arc-minute raw XYZ, blockmean filtered, surfaced to a 30-arc-second netCDF grid with a spline tension factor of 0.25 and 45-degree shading azimuth.

## Data sources

Scattered XYZ point data (topography, free-air gravity) exported from global grids (e.g. TOPEX/UCSD). Input as .xyz tables.

## File naming

Scripts follow GMT-18-script-surface-VAR-XX.sh, where VAR is the modelled quantity (topo, grav) and XX is a trench tag (KKT = Kuril-Kamchatka Trench, MT = Mariana Trench).

## Requirements

- GMT 6.x (Generic Mapping Tools): https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org
- A POSIX shell (bash/sh)
- The relevant XYZ point table(s) available locally

## Usage

Place the required XYZ table in the working directory, adjust the -R region, -I resolution and -T tension at the top of the chosen script, then run:

    bash GMT-18-script-surface-topo-KKT.sh

The script writes a PostScript file and converts it to a raster image (JPG/PNG) via psconvert.
